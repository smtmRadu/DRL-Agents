Neural Network Class contains the code for instantiating a feedforward multilayerPerceptron Neural Network that can be train heuristicaly by backpropagating user actions.

The use of this framework is done by overriding some methods where you send observations (inputs) and receive actions (outputs), creating a suitable, stable and well designed training environment or by choosing a heuristic approach. Check the documentation "How to use the Framework.docx" placed inside the folder of the version used.<br />
