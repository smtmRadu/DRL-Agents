The Neural Network Class contains the code for instantiating a Artificial Neural Network based on Evolutionary Training with random mutations.

The use of this framework is done by implementing a training strategy, strictly said by overriding some methods where you send observations (inputs) and receive actions (outputs) and creating a suitable, stable and well designed training environment.

The Documentation was not wrote yet due to lack of substantial testing. Performance leaks where solved starting from version 2.0.
Multienvironmental Training set for upcoming version 3.0.
