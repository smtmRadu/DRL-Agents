The use of this framework is done by overriding some methods where you send observations (inputs) and receive actions (outputs), creating a suitable, stable and well designed training environment or by choosing a heuristic approach (or both). Check the documentation "How to use the Framework.docx" placed inside the folder of the version used.<br />
